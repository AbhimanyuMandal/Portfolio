## **Education**  
**Integrated Dual Degree (B.Tech+M.Tech) @ Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi (_August 2019 - May 2024_)**
- **Background:** Pharmaceutical Engineering & Technology
- **CPI:** 8.74   

## **Research Experience**  
**Summer Research Intern @ University of Western Ontario, Canada (_May 2023 - August 2023_)**   
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Pingzhao Hu, Associate Professor  
- **Contributions:**
  1. 16 tumors **single-cell RNA Seq data from HER2+ and ER+ cell lines** were aligned with epithelial cells from normal breast tissues to form cell-type clusters and further identify the differentially expressed genes in each cluster.  
  2. Identified potential drug combinations, such as **Artesunate and Enalapril**, to treat breast cancer. These drugs were originally used for treating severe malaria and managing hypertension and congestive heart failures, respectively.
