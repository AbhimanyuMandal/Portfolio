## **Education**
- Integrated Dual Degree (B.Tech+M.Tech), Pharmaceutical Engineering & Technology
  _Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi_ | (_August 2019 - May 2024_)

## **Research Experience**
**Summer Research Intern @ University of Western Ontario, Canada (_May 2023 - August 2023_)**
**Supervisor:** Dr. Pingzhao Hu, Associate Professor
**Contributions:**
- 16 tumors single-cell RNA Seq data from HER2+ and ER+ cell lines were aligned with epithelial cells from normal breast tissues to identify differentially expressed genes in each cell type cluster.
- Identified potential drug combinations, such as **Artesunate and Enalapril**, to treat breast cancer. These drugs were originally used for treating severe malaria and managing hypertension and congestive heart failures, respectively.
