## **Education**  
**Integrated Dual Degree (B.Tech+M.Tech) @ Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India (_August 2019 - May 2024_)**  
- **Background:** Pharmaceutical Engineering & Technology  
- **CPI:** 8.74   

## **Research Experience**  
**Summer Research Intern @ University of Western Ontario, Canada (_May 2023 - August 2023_)** 
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Pingzhao Hu, Associate Professor
- **Topic:** Developing a deep-learning tool for drug repurposing in breast cancer treatment.   
- **Contributions:**  
  1. 16 tumors **single-cell RNA Seq data from HER2+ and ER+ cell lines** were aligned with epithelial cells from normal breast tissues to form cell-type clusters and further identify the differentially expressed genes in each cluster.  
  2. Identified potential drug combinations, such as **Artesunate and Enalapril**, to treat breast cancer. These drugs were originally used for treating severe malaria and managing hypertension and congestive heart failures, respectively.

**Master's Thesis Project @ Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India (_January 2023 - Present_)**  
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Arun Khattri, Assitant Professor  
- **Topic:** Develop a pipeline for identifying Germline Variants responsible for Oral Cancer in Indian patients.
- **Contributions:**  
  1. **Whole Exome Sequencing data from the normal tissues** of 62 OSCC-GB patients and **gene panel sequencing data** from the 120 advanced HNSCC patients were used to extract and annotate the SNPs. These SNPs were then annotated and **filtered based on their IMPACT, SIFT, and PolyPhen scores, along with their clinical significance**.  
  2. Identified some **rare pathogenic variants**, which were already annotated in the OncoKB database. Further studies were performed to understand the significance of these variants in the clinical prognosis of OSCC-GB patients. The manuscript for the study is currently under preparation.

**Undergraduate Project @ Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India (_August 2021 - December 2022_)**  
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Arun Khattri, Assistant Professor  
- **Topic:** Gene expression analysis to identify potential biomarkers among Lymphoma patients.  
- **Contributions:**  
  1. **Gene expression data** from 290 lymphoma patients were **preprocessed and classified based on their subtypes** - MCL, DLBCL, BL, FL, and MZL.  
  2. Further analysis was performed to **study the significance of different genes in each subtype**. The study shows **overexpression of both the SRGN and CD44 genes in MCL, followed by DLBCL, FL,** and **MZL**.

**Undergraduate Exploratory Project Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India (_January 2021 - May 2021_)**  
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Senthil Raja A., Associate Professor
- **Topic:** _In-silico_ neurotoxicity classification of drugs
- **Contributions:**  
  1. A list of drugs containing both Neurotoxic and Neuroprotective compounds, along with their SMILES, was collected from the **PubChem database**. The descriptors for each compound were derived from the **BioTriangle database**. After further data preprocessing, these data were used to train the machine learning model.
  2. Developed a **machine-learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, for the classification of compounds as neurotoxic/neuroprotective in nature with an **accuracy of 83%**.
     
## **Corporate Experience**  
**Biomedical Data Analyst Intern @ Elucidata Corporation, Delhi (_February 2022 - July 2022_)**  
- **Project Title: **Data Consumption board on Polly.  
- **Team members:** Dr. Meeta Sunil, Senior Bioinformatics Scientist, Saurabh Whadgar  
- **Contributions:**  
  1. Developed a **multi-modular web-based application for auditing multi-omics data** curated in their repository, Polly. Each module was designed with a specific purpose, such as providing a brief overview of the data present in the atlas, data visualization, providing a detailed overview of each atlas at the dataset level, and generating a report of all the analyses.  
  2. Users can now **visualize and compare the data across multiple atlases** and filter them based on **disease, data type, organism, tissue, cell line, cell type,** and **drugs.**
