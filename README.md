## **Education**  
**Integrated Dual Degree (B.Tech+M.Tech) @ Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India (_August 2019 - May 2024_)**
- **Background:** Pharmaceutical Engineering & Technology
- **CPI:** 8.74   

## **Research Experience**  
**Summer Research Intern @ University of Western Ontario, Canada (_May 2023 - August 2023_)**   
- **Topic:** Developing a deep-learning tool for drug repurposing in breast cancer treatment.
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Pingzhao Hu, Associate Professor  
- **Contributions:**
  1. 16 tumors **single-cell RNA Seq data from HER2+ and ER+ cell lines** were aligned with epithelial cells from normal breast tissues to form cell-type clusters and further identify the differentially expressed genes in each cluster.  
  2. Identified potential drug combinations, such as **Artesunate and Enalapril**, to treat breast cancer. These drugs were originally used for treating severe malaria and managing hypertension and congestive heart failures, respectively.

**Master's Thesis @ Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India (_January 2023 - Present_
)**
- **Topic:** Develop a pipeline for identifying Germline Variants responsible for Oral Cancer in Indian patients.
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Arun Khattri, Assitant Professor
- **Contributions:**
  1. WES data from the normal tissues of 62 OSCC-GB patients and gene panel sequencing data from 120 HNSCC patients were used to extract and annotate the SNPs. These SNPs were then annotated and **filtered based on their IMPACT, SIFT, and PolyPhen scores, along with their clinical significance**.
  2. Identified some **rare pathogenic variants**, which were already annotated in the OncoKB database. Further studies were performed to understand the significance of these variants in the clinical prognosis of OSCC-GB patients. The manuscript for the study is currently under preparation.
